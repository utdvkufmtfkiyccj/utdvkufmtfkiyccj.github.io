Mountain image category:<br>“The scale and quality of the images do justice to the stunning landscape. The devil is in the detail - McBride finds it through his lens as well as his pen.

Ultimate Experiences Magazine<br>“A masterpiece in the name of conservation.”<br> ?Renan OzturkNational Geographic photographer <br>"The Grand Canyon <br>by self- taught Colorado photographer and filmmaker Pete McBride sprang from his 2015 expedition with Kevin Fedarko (author of <br>The Emerald Mile<br>): The two men backpacked 750-plus mostly trail-less miles from Lees Ferry to Grand Wash Cliffs. Much to his credit McBride does not shy from "non-traditional" motifs that challenge viewer expectations: tangled fence-wire South Rim light pollution Havasupai protesters or a composite of jetboats and choppers clogging the river section called "Heli Alley. "The overall impression however?reinforced by grit-and-dirt adventure photography?is that the Grand Canyon still offers much-needed relief and refuge and not just to Homo sapiens."<br> ? High Country News<br>" The best Christmas books fortravelers (2018)<br>...Some 5.9 million people a year visit the Grand Canyon but fewer than a dozen have walked it from end to end a journey-without-trails of some 750 miles. The photographer Pete McBride did so with his friend Kevin Fedarko a writer and former river guide in Grand Canyon National Park. With the park’s centenary approaching they share what they found in the canyon’s remote ribs and report on the continuing struggle between conservation and exploitation (they logged 363 helicopter flights in the space of eight hours). As McBride puts it "If we cannot protect this space the seventh natural wonder of the world what can we protect?""<br>?
